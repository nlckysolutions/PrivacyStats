# PrivacyStats

PrivacyStats checks your Android device’s privacy level based on installed packages. 

PrivacyStats has 3 built in lists of apps, ranging from apps with 1-2 trackers, to apps with 5-6 trackers.
It will scan apps against these lists, and show you the apps, with uninstall buttons for user-apps, and disable buttons for system apps.

It does not use an internet connection at all, and only has the permission: QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES.
